## How it works

output 0 uses OR logic via input 1 and input 2
output 1 uses AND logic via input 2 and input 3
output 2 uses XOR logic via input 4 and input 5
output 3 uses NAND logic via input 5 and input 6

## How to test

Start the simulation and press the on and off switches to play around with the logics.

## External hardware

None
