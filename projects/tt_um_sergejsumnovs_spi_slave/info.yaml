  description:  "An SPI slave demo component for the Cynergy4MIE project (and also my master's thesis). It has GPIO, LFSR and PWM."        # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "VHDL"    # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     20000000  # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x2"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_sergejsumnovs_spi_slave"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
