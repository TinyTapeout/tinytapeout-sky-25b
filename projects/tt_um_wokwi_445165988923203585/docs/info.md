## How it works

It is super complicated, even I don't know. It's just a bunch of gates that are thrown together to see how they will react with each other. A fun experiment. 

## How to test

Just hook it up to a seven-segment or an LED bar so see if it works or not. When everything is off the seven-segment should show 4.

## External hardware

DIP switch, resistors, and LED bar graph/seven-segment display.
