## How it works

2-bit 7 segment driver. It converts a 2-bit binary (0-3) to 7-segment display pin outputs.

## How to test

Inputs 0 and 1 correspond to input bits 0 and 1. Output pins connect to 7-segment display:

0: a
1: b
2: c
3: d
4: e
5: f
6: g
7: dp

## External hardware

Drive it with whatever you want.
