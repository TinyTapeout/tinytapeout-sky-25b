  description:  "An 8-bit TinyTapeout function generator targeting the AD5330 parallel DAC. By default it outputs a sine wave. Via a simple write-only register interface you can switch to a constant DC level or a programmable trapezoid/pulse, and tune amplitude, offset, phase, and timing. An on-chip timer (prescaler + counter) sets the sample rate, a CORDIC core computes the sine, and a small FSM drives the trapezoid. Data goes out on uo_out[7:0], with active-low DAC control (dac_wr_n, dac_pd_n, dac_clr_n) on uio_out[2:0]."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     20000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
