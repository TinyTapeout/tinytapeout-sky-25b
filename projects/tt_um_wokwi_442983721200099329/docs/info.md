## How it works

I use the DIP Switch 8. If you switch on the first, second, fith, eighth switch you change something in the currcuit. The first end second go into a XOR-gate. The fifth and eighth go into an AND-gate. The outpit of those two go into an AND-gate as well. The output of this one goes to the fourth to sixth output to give out my initial L on the Seven Segment Display.
## How to test

Switch on and of the four mantioned switches. As long as only one of the first switches and both of the later ones are active you should get the correct output.
